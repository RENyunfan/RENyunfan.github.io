description:  Design, Control and Analysis of a Dual-arm Continuum Flexible Robot System

# Introduction

> From January to June 2019, RENyunfan participated in a scientific research on line-driven robots. This project was about after he completed the quadruped robot. He felt that most existing foot robots were based on rigid body kinematics and could not be as flexible as humans. The line-driven robot is closer to the muscle fibers of the human body. From the perspective of bionics, the line-driven robot is more promising. In order to further understand this field, RENyunfan conducted a half-year research on the dual-arm cooperation of a line-driven flexible robotic machine, and finally formed a paper named *Design, Control and Analysis of a Dual-arm Continuum Flexible Robot System* with his team members and was accepted by the IEEE. International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics. In November 2019, RENyunfan made a oral report on this paper at the conference.

# Abstract

Multi-arm flexible robot can cooperate with each other to achieve complex surgical actions during operation. In this paper, we propose the mechanical structure design, control and analysis of a dual-arm continuum flexible robot for surgical task that needs multi-tools cooperation. The movement of a single arm is controlled by a set of flexible wires. The two arms work together under control of a remote device to perform actions such as gripping and cutting, which cannot be done with single arm. Kinematic model of the flexible arm has been established. Accuracy of the motion has been tested and verified. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.
