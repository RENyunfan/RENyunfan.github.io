\| Harbin Institute of Technology \|  Research Assistant	\|Feb 2019- Oct. 2019

Advisor: Shuang Song, assistant  professor at School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, HIT

* Made Structural innovation and customized the motion control algorithm correspondent to the line-driven, result in smaller robot arms.
*  Designed flexibel robot, to easily move around in narrow cavities and help medical workers perform operations.
* Oral presentation at the *2019 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics*.

## **CPG based parallel quadruped robot** 

\| Harbin Institute of Technology \|  Research Assistant	\|Feb 2019- May 2019 

Advisor: Yunjiang Lou, Professor and Dean at School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, HIT. 

- Used a ODE, Hoff oscillator, to complete the gait generation of the quadruped robot with very low computational complexity.
- Adopted novel equations and applied them to the parallel eight-degree-of-freedom quadruped robot. Drew on the ideas from a fish robot using the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) method.
- Won the National Second Prize in the National University Student Robot Competition.
