# Introduction

Most of the existing writing robots are only suitable for small scenes, and cannot be used for whiteboard writing scenes such as classrooms and meetings. At the same time, traditional writing robots are usually XY platform configurations. This structure is very wasteful of space and extremely unportable. To this end, we have designed a five-bar parallel manipulator structure, which can be very portable after special folding design.

Due to the special two-fold design, this structure can be small as a MacBook Pro 13''.
